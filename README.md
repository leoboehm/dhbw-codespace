# GitHub DHBW Codespace

## Welcome to my Codespace!
In here I will be sharing the code we're working on in our weekly lessons as well as my own projects!

Here's an overview of what I uploaded:

### Lessons
1. Xes N Os: A small console api that asks you an even number and then prints out a tree of x's and o's.
2. Rock Paper Scissors: A reduced console version of Rock, paper, Scissors against the Computer.
3. Sequels:
   * Fibonacci: Prints out the first 10 numbers of the fibonacci sequel.
   * Rows: Takes a number as user input and prints out the number as many times as the number ist high (input 5: "55555")
   * Prime Checker: Takes a number as user input and prints out whether the number is a prime or not.

### Snake
My first project, the game of snake.
The game consists of a character, the snake, that is moving over the window on key press. The snake gains points by "eating" randomly spawning apples. With each apple, the snake grows larger. If the snake bites it's own tail, the game is over. The main goal is to collect as many apples and survive as long as possible!
